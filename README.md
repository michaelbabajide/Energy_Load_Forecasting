# Energy Load Forecasting

This project is focused on training and testing machine learning forecasting algorithms to predict electricity load, and compare these forecasts with the official predictions from the weekly pre-dispatch reports. The goal of this project is to improve forecasting accuracy and to provide a better understanding of the factors that influence electricity load in Panama.

## Dataset

The dataset is composed of data from multiple sources, including:

- Historical electricity load, available on the daily post-dispatch records, from the grid operator (CND).
- Historical weekly forecasts available on weekly pre-dispatch reports, both from CND.
- Calendar information related to school periods, from Panama's Ministry of education.
- Calendar information related to holidays, from 'When on Earth?' website.
- Weather variables, such as temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, and wind speed, for three main cities in Panama, from Earthdata.
