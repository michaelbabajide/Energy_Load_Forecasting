# Energy Load Forecasting

This project is focused on training and testing machine learning forecasting algorithms to predict electricity load, and compare these forecasts with the official predictions from the weekly pre-dispatch reports. The goal of this project is to improce forecasting accuracy and to provide a better understanding of the factors that influence electricity load in Panama.

## Dataset

The dataset is composed of data from multiple sources, including:

- Historical electricity load, available on the daily post-dispatch records, from the grid operator (CND).
-
